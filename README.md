# Smart-Environment-Monitoring-System-using-IOT

In this project, we present the design and implementation of a Smart Environmental Monitoring System utilizing DHT11 sensors for humidity and temperature measurement, along with rainfall sensors integrating with ESP8266. The system aims to accurately detect environmental conditions and provide real-time notifications to users via email and messages through phone. The integration with the Blynk app enhances user accessibility and control.
